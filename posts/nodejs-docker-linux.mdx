## Introduction  
Docker makes it easy to package and deploy Node.js applications. Instead of worrying about environment differences, you can create a container that works anywhere. This guide will walk you through containerizing a Node.js app using Docker.  

## Dependencies  
Make sure you have Docker installed. You can check by running:  

```sh
docker -v
```

If it's not installed, head over to [Docker’s official site](https://www.docker.com/) and follow the installation guide for your OS.  

## Setting Up a Node.js Project  
If you don’t have a Node.js app yet, create one:  

```sh
mkdir my-node-app && cd my-node-app
npm init -y
```

Then, install Express for a simple web server:  

```sh
npm install express
```

Create an `index.js` file:  

```js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const PORT = 3000;

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello, Docker!");
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

## Writing a Dockerfile  
A `Dockerfile` defines how your app will be containerized. Create a new file named `Dockerfile` in your project directory and add this:  

```dockerfile
# Use official Node.js image
FROM node:18

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and install dependencies
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy app files
COPY . .

# Expose port
EXPOSE 3000

# Command to run app
CMD ["node", "index.js"]
```

## Building and Running the Container  
Now, let's build the Docker image:  

```sh
docker build -t my-node-app .
```

Run the container:  

```sh
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-node-app
```

Your app should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).  

## Managing the Container  
To list running containers:  

```sh
docker ps
```

To stop a running container:  

```sh
docker stop <container_id>
```

To remove a container:  

```sh
docker rm <container_id>
```

## Conclusion  
That's it! You've successfully containerized a Node.js application using Docker. Now, you can deploy it anywhere Docker runs. If you need to scale, just spin up more containers.
